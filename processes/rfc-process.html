      <h1 id="sel4-request-for-comments-rfc-process">seL4 Request for Comments (RFC) Process</h1>

<p>We have introduced the request for comments (RFC) process for the following
reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to allow the community to discuss design changes in seL4,</li>
  <li>to gather valuable feedback from the community
on changes the Foundation is considering,</li>
  <li>to allow members of the seL4 community
to get support and approval
to propose and implement their own changes
to the seL4 ecosystem,</li>
  <li>to ensure that all changes
made to core components of the seL4 ecosystem
or that have wide and varying impacts on users of seL4
undergo rigorous review, and</li>
  <li>to ensure large changes are well advertised
and can viewed publicly
before contributors commit to implementing them.</li>
</ul>

<p>This helps the seL4 community ensure that such changes are made
with the goal of the best outcome for the most users of seL4
whilst maintaining the seL4 guarantees of isolation and security.</p>

<p>To see all current RFCs, go check out the <a href="https://sel4kernel.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10103" title="RFC dashboard">RFC dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>You can also stay notified
of new RFCs and updates to RFCs
by joining the <a href="https://lists.sel4.systems/postorius/lists/rfc.sel4.systems/" title="RFC announcement mailing list">RFC announcement mailing list</a>.
You can then use you <a href="https://id.atlassian.com/" title="Atlassian Cloud Login">Atlassian Cloud</a> account
to keep track of and contribute to discussion
on each of the RFCs.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-follow-the-rfc-process">When to follow the RFC process</h2>

<p>All substantial changes to the seL4 ecosystem
must be made using the RFC process.
Substantial changes are those that that
impact a large number of users of seL4
in a way that may require them to change their own projects,
changes the operation of toolchain used to build projects on seL4,
changes the underlying model of one or more software components
within the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Examples of changes that must follow the RFC process include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removing support for a platform</li>
  <li>Changing the versioning system used for libraries</li>
  <li>Adding a new major API feature to the kernel</li>
  <li>Adding a new operation/invocation to an existing capability type, or removing one</li>
  <li>Adding or removing a capability or object type</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes such as bug-fixes, refactorings, optimisations,
or those that do not affect the functional requirements
of the kernel, supporting tooling, infrastructure,
or system components
can be made through the existing pull-request process
on the relevant repository.</p>

<p>Examples of changes that should not involve the RFC process include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixing a typo in existing code,</li>
  <li>Clarifying code or documentation,</li>
  <li>Adding a driver to an existing layer of the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you try to make a substantial change
via the pull-request process,
your request is likely to be rejected
and you will be asked to use the RFC process
to propose your change.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether a change requires an RFC,
ask on the <a href="https://mattermost.trustworthy.systems/sel4-external/" title="seL4 Mattermost">seL4 Mattermost</a> chat
or post a question to the <a href="https://lists.sel4.systems/postorius/lists/devel.sel4.systems/" title="seL4 development mailing list">development mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-rfc-process">The RFC Process</h2>

<h3 id="before-creating-a-new-rfc">Before creating a new RFC</h3>

<p>Before proposing a new RFC
it is important to determine whether it will be supported
and what possible options exist
to solve the particular problem.</p>

<p>This should be done through discussion
one one of the many community forums
such as the <a href="https://mattermost.trustworthy.systems/sel4-external/" title="seL4 Mattermost">seL4 Mattermost</a> chat
or the <a href="https://lists.sel4.systems/postorius/lists/devel.sel4.systems/" title="seL4 development mailing list">development mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>This part of the process should help you determine
whether your idea has already been proposed,
whether or not it fits with the near-term goals of the ecosystem,
and how to propose it with the best chances of acceptance.</p>

<p>You should make sure that during this discussion
you address each of the sections in the template below.
This will ensure that your proposal is well prepared
before it is formally presented as an RFC
and will speed up much of the RFC process.</p>

<p>Once you have the support of some existing seL4 developers
they can help you take your idea
through the rest of the RFC process.</p>

<p>After discussion, RFCs will ultimately be approved, postponed, or rejected by
a decision of the <a href="https://sel4.systems/Foundation/TSC/">Technical Steering Committee</a> of the seL4 Foundation.</p>

<h3 id="proposing-an-new-rfc">Proposing an new RFC</h3>

<p>An RFC exists in the form of an RFC <em>issue</em>
on the <a href="https://sel4kernel.atlassian.net/browse/RFC" title="seL4 RFCs">RFC project</a> of the seL4 <a href="https://sel4kernel.atlassian.net/" title="seL4 Atlassian Cloud">Jira</a> instance.
Anyone who has an <a href="https://id.atlassian.com/" title="Atlassian Cloud Login">Atlassian Cloud</a> account
is able to create an RFC.</p>

<p>You should check the postponed RFCs
to see if your idea has already been proposed
but was previously postponed.
You can adopt a postponed RFC
which will return it to the proposal stage
and you will become responsible for it.</p>

<p>Once you create an RFC,
you are the one responsible for maintaining it
throughout the approval process.
You will be able to modify it
in response to discussion and feedback
up until the point it is either approved or rejected.</p>

<p>Every RFC should use the template below,
omitting sections that are not relevant for the RFC.</p>

<h4 id="the-rfc-template">The RFC template</h4>

<p>You should consider each section of the RFC template in depth
before determining that it is not relevant.</p>

<p>You will probably want to work on this offline
during the initial discussion
so that you can paste the final document
into the issue description
when you create the RFC issue.</p>

<pre><code class="language-wiki">h1. Summary

One paragraph explanation of the change.

h1. Motivation

- Why are we doing this?
- What use cases does it support?
- What is the expected outcome?

h1. Guide-level explanation

Explain the change or feature as you would to another user of seL4.

This section should clearly outline new named concepts, provide some examples of how it will be used, and explain how users should *think* about it.

You should describe the change in a manner that is clear to both existing seL4 users and to new users of the ecosystem.

Any changes that existing users need to make either as a result of the RFC or such that the can use the feature should be clearly stated here.

h1. Reference-level explanation

Explain the change or feature as you would to the maintainers of the seL4 ecosystem.

This section should provide sufficient technical detail to guide any related implementation and ongoing maintenance.

This section should clearly describe how this change will interact with the existing ecosystem, describe particular complex examples that may complicate the implementation, and describe how the implementation should support the examples in the previous section.

h1. Drawbacks

Outline any arguments that have been made against this proposal and discuss why we may not want to accept it.  Also discuss any complications that may arise from the proposed change that may require specific consideration.

h1. Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

h1. Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.  A few examples of what this can include are:

- For ecosystem proposals: Does this feature exist in similar systems and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this?  If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other systems, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.  If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other systems.

Note that while precedent set by other systems is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.

h1. Unresolved questions

- What needs to be resolved in further discussion before the RFC is approved?
- What needs to resolved during the implementation of this RFC?
- What related questions are beyond the scope of this RFC that should be addressed beyond its implementation?
</code></pre>

<h3 id="getting-an-rfc-approved">Getting an RFC approved</h3>

<p>After you propose an RFC, it is likely to undergo several rounds of changes
in response to the discussion on <a href="https://sel4kernel.atlassian.net/" title="seL4 Atlassian Cloud">Jira</a>. Anyone is allowed to engage in
this discussion.</p>

<p>Once the discussion phase is concluded, for instance because consensus has
been reached or it has become clear that there will not be a consensus, the
Technical Steering Committee of the seL4 Foundation will make a decision on
the RFC.</p>

<p>The Steering Committee will either give stage 1 approval, fully approve,
postpone, defer, require changes, or reject the RFC. When this occurs, a
<em>disposition</em> will be added to the RFC outlining the reason for the particular
ruling. If the discussion of an RFC has been particularly long, a summary
comment will be made on the RFC before the given ruling is made.</p>

<h4 id="postponement-of-an-rfc">Postponement of an RFC</h4>

<p>When an RFC has a moderate amount of support
and is generally accepted as a good idea
but lacks someone to shepherd it
to the point where it can be accepted
it is <em>postponed</em>.</p>

<p>This indicates that the RFC may be revived in the future
when someone can be found to take it through
the remainder of the approval process.
Anyone may <em>adopt</em> a postponed RFC
if they wish to see it approved
and want to rally support for it.</p>

<h3 id="stage-1-approval">Stage 1 approval</h3>

<p>In some cases, an RFC may require an implementation or very detailed design to
properly judge its merits. When the TSC decides that an RFC is likely to get
accepted if a convincing implementation can be shown, the TSC may give <em>stage 1
approval</em> for this RFC. Stage 1 approval means a candidate implementation should
go ahead, but will need to be reviewed again, e.g. for performance and
usability, before it can be fully accepted.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-of-an-approved-rfc">Implementation of an approved RFC</h3>

<p>Once the Steering Committee approves an RFC,
it is marked as <em>active</em>.
They may then assign it to a contributor for implementation.
Issues for the implementation of the necessary components
will be created and linked to the RFC.</p>

<p>The implementation of an RFC
may lead to the resolution of many issues
that were present in the RFC
when it was approved.
As such, the RFC may be subject to further changes
throughout this part of the process.
These changes should not change
the overall goals or design of the RFC
but should merely resolve issues
or extend the design to cope
with unanticipated corner cases.</p>

<h4 id="deferment-of-an-approved-rfc">Deferment of an approved RFC</h4>

<p>There may not be sufficient resources
to implement an RFC when it is approved
or resources may be diverted
from the implementation of an RFC
when higher priority work arises.
In either case, the RFC will be <em>deferred</em>.
A <em>deferred</em> RFC is lower priority than an <em>active</em> one
and will generally see no progress on its implementation.</p>

<p>Anyone can request that a <em>deferred</em> RFC be given priority
be demonstrating increased demand or urgency for its
implementation, volunteering to work on the implementation,
or find funding for the Foundation to implement it.</p>
